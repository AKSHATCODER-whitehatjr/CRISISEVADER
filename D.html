<h2>What's The Problem?</h2>
<p> 
Deforestation threatens the world's biodiversity.
<br>
Tropical forests are where most of deforestation happens.
<br>
They are also home to many species of wildlife.
<br>
These species can even go extinct because of deforestation.
<br>
Deforestation also results in carbon dioxide being released in the atmosphere.
<br>
This is because trees take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, and when trees are cut down, the carbon dioxide gets released.
</p>
<h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
<p>
Firstly, you can use browsers like Ecosia.
<br>
Browsers like Ecosia do things like plant trees when you search.
<br>
You can choose recycled items.
<br>
You can also plant trees near your home.
