<h2>What's The Problem?</h2>
<p> 
Climate change impacts the temperature and weather of the world we live in.
<br>
Temperature and weather changes today are happening more because of humans than nature.
<br>
There are several impacts on the Earth because of climate change.
<br>
Deserts are expanding, heatwaves and wildfires are becoming more common.
<br>
Increased warming in the Arctic is melting permafrost, glacial retreat, and sea ice loss.
<br>
Higher temperatures also cause instense storms, droughts, and more extreme weather.
<br>
This also changes mountains, coral reefs, and forces arctic animals to relocate or go extinct.
<br>
</p>
<h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
<p>
There are many ways to help stop this crisis.
<br>
You can turn of the lights when not in a room, you can take quicker showers.
