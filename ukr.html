<br>
<h2>What's The Problem?</h2>
<p>
On Thursday, February 24th, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine.
<br>
This is when most people learned about the Russo-Ukrainian War,
but it really started on February 20th, 2014.  
<br>
From 2014-2022, conflict included the Russian annexation of Crimea, the war in Donbas, naval incidents, and cyber warfare.
<br>
In late 2021 and early 2022, there was a major Russian build-up around Ukraine borders.
<br>
The conflict became significantly greater when Russia launched a full scale invasion on Ukraine, on February 24th, 2022.
<br>
Thousands of civilians and troops on both sides have lost their lives, and millions were forced to flee their homes.
