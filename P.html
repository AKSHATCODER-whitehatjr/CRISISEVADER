<h2>What's The Problem?</h2>
<p> 
Environmental pollution, Water pollution, and Air pollution, all affect the Earth.
<br>
Pollution makes our planet more and more uninhabitable.
<br>
Pollution can travel very far.
<br>
Some chemicals from pollution traveled all the way to Antarctica.
<br>
There is some much pollution, that, even in the ocean, there are many large garbage patches, one being almost the size of Texas!
<br>
All living things, from one-celled organisms to blue whales depend on water, air, and other natural resources.
<br>
Pollution is destroying these things and endangering all life on earth.
<br>
Pollution also makes the beautiful "blue marble" look worse.
<br>
</p>
<h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
<p>
There are many ways to help prevent pollution.
<br>
Use recyclables, and reusable items.
<br>
Try using bicycles, electric cars, or walking to prevent air pollution, which can also cause climate change.
<br>
You can use special browsers like ocg.org that pick up trash when you search.
<br>
Tell many people about it, so they can stop pollution too.
